µPCN POSIX-Performance-Test-Tool
================================

This program is used to gather performance data during the execution of µPCN
testcases.

It starts dumping relevant data when receiving a signal from a running µPCN
instance and stops when receiving another one. During the execution, the µPCN
instance can send additional signals to mark relevant dates.
